## Basic Concept
The player must find all the lost cats hiding in the trees within the time limit. The player finds cats by approaching trees and shaking them. Each cat is worth one point. However, dogs may also fall from the trees. If the player collects a dog, they lose three points. The game ends after the time limit.
